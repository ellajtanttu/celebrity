## Technologies Used

## Description

_Exercise Prompt:_
* _Create a celebrity dating webpage, where you enter information about yourself, and the page suggests which celebrity, fictional character, or public figure you would be most compatible with._
* _Make both sites check for any form fields the user has left blank. If you're checking multiple fields, don't pop up a dialog box for each one; that could get annoying if the user has left multiple fields blank! Instead, insert text next to the field the user has missed. Bootstrap has some nice styles for this - check out the Validation section of their form documentation._
